## What's my project about?
Well, this is my blog, I coded the backend using JavaScript, specifically Node.js, and the frontend using React.js
It's just a kind of landing page right now, but then I'm gonna add more functionalities

Also I designed all its UI using Figma
And I used babel for the project's build

## What did I learn?
Firstly, I learned how to implement lowDB (A database in a json file)
Then how to use GitHub workflows, and a bit of Unit Testing in Node.js with mocha and chai, and how to use a kind of CI/CD with GitHub Workflows and Heroku
